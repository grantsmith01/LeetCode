        Make a copy list and sort the words in that list alphabetically. Then, create a hashMap with the sorted words as keys and their indices as values.
        For the duplicate keys, aka the anagrams, add their index to a list. You will end up with a hashMap where you can look up a word and find
        the indices of all its anagrams.

        Loop through all keys in hashMap. Add the strs values at the index of the key-value pair to the anagrams list, then add that list to the solution
